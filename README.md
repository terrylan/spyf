# SPyF-RAG: AI-Optimized Standard Python Framework (Lean & Adaptive v2.0)

**Tagline**: "Lightweight. Scalable. AI-Powered. Your Python MVC, Evolved."

Welcome to **SPyF-RAG**—a lean, adaptive Python MVC framework that builds exactly what you need, from a 4GB Linux device to a 50,000-user cloud system. Inspired by Terrylan Manalansan’s SPMP, SPyF v2.0 rivals Flask and Django with cutting-edge AI, async processing, and hardware-aware design.

## What is SPyF-RAG?
SPyF-RAG is a Python framework that scales with your vision. Define your hardware and user needs, and it generates a tailored solution—fast, secure, and smart. Version 2.0 brings:
- **Async Power**: Handle tasks concurrently with `asyncio`.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate TensorFlow for predictive features.
- **Dependency Injection**: Flexibly manage components at runtime.
- **Cross-Language APIs**: Connect with other ecosystems.
- **Profiling & Recovery**: Auto-optimize and self-heal errors.
- **Enhanced ORM**: Complex relationships and migrations built-in.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Live data feeds with ease.
- **Distributed Scaling**: Cluster-ready for massive deployments.
- **AI Debugging**: Smart fixes from integrated tools.

## Why SPyF?
- **Lean Core**: Minimal overhead, maximum adaptability.
- **AI-Driven**: Optimizes for your exact hardware and scale.
- **Scales Anywhere**: From a single user to enterprise clouds.
